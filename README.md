# Convenient macron hotkeys for typing Latin

This AutoHotkey script maps Alt+vowel keys to print macronised versions of those
letters.

For example, Alt+o will type ō, and Alt+Shift+o will type Ō.

It will also automatically replace any sequence of a+e with æ and o+e with œ.

## How to use

1. Install AutoHotkey from their website: https://www.autohotkey.com/
2. Download this script from here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/esthermations/AutoHotkeysForLatin/master/Latin.ahk
    - (Right-click and "Save page" to download it)
3. Double-click the downloaded Latin.ahk file
4. You should see a green "H" icon in your taskbar if it's working.

Happy typing!
