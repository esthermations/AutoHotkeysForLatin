# Convenient macron hotkeys for typing Latin

This AutoHotkey script maps Alt+vowel keys to print macronised versions of those
letters.

For example, Alt+o will type ō, and Alt+Shift+o will type Ō.

It will also automatically replace any sequence of a+e with æ and o+e with œ.

## How to use

1. Install AutoHotkey from [their website](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
2. Download Latin.ahk from the [releases page](https://github.com/esthermations/AutoHotkeysForLatin/releases).
3. Double-click the downloaded Latin.ahk file
4. You should see a green "H" icon in your taskbar if it's working.

Happy typing!
