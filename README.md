# Convenient macron hotkeys for typing Latin

Features:
 - Macronised vowels on Alt+vowel (Alt+a produces ā, for example)
 - Long s (ſ) on Alt+s
 - Automatic conversion of ae into æ and oe into œ

All but the alt+vowel macronisation are optional and can be disabled or enabled as you please using the included GUI configuration tool, which opens when you type Alt+z.

## How to use

1. Install AutoHotkey from [their website](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
2. Download the .ahk script from the [releases page](https://github.com/esthermations/AutoHotkeysForLatin/releases).
3. Double-click the script to start it.
4. You should see a green "H" icon in your taskbar if it's working.

Happy typing!
